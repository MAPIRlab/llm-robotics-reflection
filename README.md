## Article

The article is currently under review in the MDPI Robotics Journal. 
Its preliminary (and not reviewed) version has been published [in this Preprints.org link](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202501.0131).

The abstract of the article is as follows:

> Large Language Models (LLMs) provide cognitive capabilities that enable robots to interpret and reason about their workspace, especially when paired with semantically rich representations like semantic maps.
> However, these models are prone to generating inaccurate or invented responses, known as hallucinations, that can produce erratic robotic operation.
> This can be addressed by employing agentic workflows, structured processes that guide and refine the model's output to improve response quality.
> This work formally defines and qualitatively analyzes the impact of three agentic workflows (LLM Ensemble, Self-Reflection, and Multi-Agent Reflection) on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of an LLM guiding a robotic system to perform object-centered planning.
> In this context, the LLM is provided with a pre-built semantic map of the environment and a query, to which it must respond by determining the most relevant objects for the query.
> This response can be used in a multitude of downstream tasks.
> Extensive experiments were carried out employing state-of-the-art LLMs and semantic maps generated from the widely-used datasets ScanNet and SceneNN.
> Results show that agentic workflows significantly enhance object retrieval performance, especially in scenarios requiring complex reasoning, with improvements averaging up to 10% over the baseline.

## Directory Structure

The more relevant parts of this repository are the self-created **dataset** and the **prompts** of the considered agentic workflows.

### Dataset

One of this work's contributions is a novel dataset consisting of semantic maps, predefined queries, and annotated responses. 
It can be found in the [data](https://github.com/MAPIRlab/llm-robotics-reflection/tree/main/data) folder, and consists of the following files and folders:

- [data/semantic_maps/](https://github.com/MAPIRlab/llm-robotics-reflection/tree/main/data/semantic_maps): folder contains the semantic maps generated by Voxeland, in JSON format.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MAPIRlab/llm-robotics-reflection.git
    cd mdpi-reflection
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv virtual_environment
    source virtual_environment/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
    # source virtual_environment/bin/activate    # On Unix or MacOS
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the credentials**.
As explained in the paper, the considered workflows have been implemented using LLMs from the Google Gemini family, specifically Gemini 1.5. Pro and Gemini 1.0 Pro.
The results presented in the paper come from Gemini 1.5 Pro.
In this repository, it is possible to run the workflows using LLMs from OpenAI, specifically ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo and ChatGPT 4-0.
If more models are to be used, they would have to be implemented, slightly modifying the files in the [src/llm/](https://github.com/MAPIRlab/llm-robotics-reflection/tree/main/src/llm) folder.
For running these proprietary models, we need to setup their credentials.

   4.1. Google Gemini LLMs. The Google Vertex AI JSON containing the credentials of a service account should be placed in a `/credentials` folder. Then, the constants related to Google credentials in the `constants.py` file (`GOOGLE_GEMINI_CREDENTIALS_FILENAME`, `GOOGLE_GEMINI_PROJECT_ID`, and `GOOGLE_GEMINI_PROJECT_LOCATION`) should be modified accordingly.

   4.2. OpenAI LLMs. A file called `.env` file should be created in the root of this directory. This file should contain the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` containing the user-specific OpenAI API key.

## Usage

This repository' functionality is divided into three scripts:

- `main.py`: produces an object-centered planning response for each query on each semantic map, using the considered workflows.
- `evaluate.py`: evaluates the results generated by the agentic workflows against the ground truth, generating the tables and charts presented in the paper.
- `annotate.py`: GUI useful for generating the ground truth of annotated responses for each query-semantic map pair.

### `main.py`

This script generates responses using a specific agentic workflow on a number of semantic maps from the dataset.

**Parameters:**
- `-n`, `--number-maps`: Number of semantic maps on which the queries will be evaluated using a specific agentic workflow to obtain responses. Semantic maps are processed in alphabetical order.
- `--mode`: Semantic maps input mode to LLMs, with uncertainty or not.
- `--method`: Which agentic workflow to execute?
- `-l`, `--llm`: Which LLM to use in the workflow?
- `-i`, `--reflection-iterations`: Number of reflection iterations in the Self-Reflection and Multi-Agent Reflection workflows.

### `evaluate.py`

Once the responses for the workflows have been generated, this script evaluates the results, comparing them against the ground truth.

**Parameters:**
- `-e`, `--evaluation`: Evaluation result to show (e.g. table of workflows comparison, chart with performance depending on number of objects...).
- `-n`, `--number-maps`: Number of semantic maps whose responses will be evaluated. Semantic maps are processed in alphabetical order.
- `--mode`: Semantic maps input mode to LLMs, with uncertainty or not.
- `-l`, `--llm`: Which LLM to evaluate?
- `-m`, `--metric`: Metric to consider in the performance vs semantic map complexity chart.
- `-i`, `--reflection-iterations`: Number of reflection iterations in the Self-Reflection and Multi-Agent Reflection workflows.

- ### `annotatey.py`

This script opens a GUI useful for annotating the ground truth responses, for each query-semantic map pair.
When executed, a screen like the following will open:
